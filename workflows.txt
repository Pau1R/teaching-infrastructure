teacher algorithm:
0) determine lesson scope
1) outline theory in xmind
2) create a summary of the theory
3) split theory to four blocks of knowledge for transfer
4) run lesson creation

--- LESSON CREATION ---

initial data:
- theory summary
- student average grade, difficulty modifier, overall difficulty modifier
- task time limit (add a safe margin of 3 minutes for pr)

expected result:
- lesson:
  - create the lesson folder (e.g. Урок 5 (20.11). Циклы) in python2025_tasks lessons folder
  - create a lesson description in the folder (e.g. Урок 5.md)
- tasks:
  - for each block of theory create a folder (e.g. 1)
  - in each folder create individualized tasks for each student (check for errors after creating)
- file mini_test.md in lesson folder with link to onlinetestpad.com test
- homework:
  - create a homework folder in lessons folder
  - create individualized homework for each student

--- MINI TEST CREATION ---

1) generate questions and answers
2) interact with onlinetestpad to create the test. Open it.
3) save test link to mini_test.md

--- LESSON RUNNING ---
python2026 lesson file contains links that activate each task and mini test
0) theory transfered
1) corresponding link pressed
2) task links created in each students github repo (on press - site opens with discription)
3) on link press task descriptions loaded to site from students repo
4) timer started
... student working ...
5) pr created
6) run copilot analysis:
  - do checks:
    - correspondance to task description
    - errors
    - code style
  - generate report:
    - description of the errors
    - success percentage
  - save success percentage for lesson grading
  - accumulate report to student progress info
   (generate success percentage)
  - ask student if he thinks the success percentage was to low
7) if more comments made in pr - notify teacher
8) if task submitted too late - set success percentage to 0.
... all iterations finished ...
mini_test:
1) corresponding link pressed - students repo gets test link
... student working ...
2) test result sent to telegram
3) test result appended to student
4) lesson grade for student becomes available (probably via telegram bot)
Assigning grades:
- subtract from auto value if student behaved badly or add if very good (prefere topcoins for this). 
- give topcoins for activeness

--- HOMEWORK ---
- don't limit execution time
- if submission time is exceeded - lower grade correspondingly.
- keep track of two grades:
  - tech grade
  - omni grade (with subtractions)
